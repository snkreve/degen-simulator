    This Casino Simulator models a real-world gambling environment by simulating thousands of players with varying betting behaviors. It calculates casino profits, player winnings, and overall Return to Player (RTP) based on defined game conditions.

    ### How It Works
    **Player Simulation**  
    - Each player starts with a random deposit amount based on a log-normal distribution.
    - Players place bets at multipliers of 10x, 100x, or 1000x of their deposit.

    **House Edge Calculation**  
    - Every bet has a defined House Edge (default 1%), representing the casino's statistical advantage.
    - Expected losses are calculated as wager * house edge.

    **Actual Game Outcomes**  
    - Actual losses are randomly distributed around the expected value using a normal distribution.
    - Some players may lose less or more than expected due to natural variance.

    **Bonus System**  
    - Weekly Bonus, Monthly Bonus, Rakeback: Calculated as wager * house edge * bonus percentage.
    - Loseback: Based on actual player losses and refunded at a specified percentage.

    **Casino Profit & RTP Calculation**  
    - The total casino profit is calculated as actual losses - total bonuses paid.
    - RTP (Return to Player) is derived from the total winnings distributed to players.

    **Key Features**
    âœ… Supports custom number of players  
    âœ… Adjustable House Edge, Bonuses, and Loseback  
    âœ… Provides a detailed summary of casino performance  
    âœ… CSV export option for further analysis  

    **Summary Calculation Formula**
    - **Expected Loss** = Wager * House Edge
    - **Actual Loss** = Randomized loss (simulated variance)
    - **Bonus Calculation** = Wager * House Edge * Bonus Percentage
    - **Loseback Calculation** = Actual Loss * Loseback Percentage
    - **Total Bonus Paid** = Bonus + Loseback
    - **Expected Profit** = Expected Loss - Bonus
    - **Actual Profit** = Actual Loss - Total Bonus
    - **Expected RTP** = 1 - House Edge
    - **Actual RTP** = 1 - (Actual Profit / Wager)
